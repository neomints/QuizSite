  <h1>Our Troublesome Journey</h1>
  <p>Hello! Our team presents you with our super-duper site which is probably a rip-off of buzzfeed. TRIVIO! We came up with the idea during the user experience exercise and since it was theoretically possible (emphasis on the THEORETICALLY ), we foolishly threw ourselves into the pit of fire (and more importantly: HOURS OF LATE NIGHT CODING! It's cool though, it was fun. We made a website!)
    Trivio is supposed to be used as a social media site specifically for making, sharing and viewing quiz and trivia of the user's choice. By singing up, users can share their favorite quizzes with their friends online. When they want something new, they can click on the RANDOM QUIZ GENERATOR button. They can even make a quiz on their own by using
    We tried to incorporate all aspects of the coding classes, i.e.: HTML5, CSS3, UX, Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery. It was really fun and challenging to play around with different attributes and explore and use new tags and tools.
    ENJOY!!!
